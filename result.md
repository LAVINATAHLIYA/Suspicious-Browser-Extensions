## Suspicious Browser Extensions
# Brave Extension Audit - [06/09/2025]  
### **Removed Extensions**  
1. **Ad Block**  
   - Reason: Redundant (Brave has built-in ad-blocking).  
   - Risk: None, but unnecessary resource usage.  

2. **Scribble**  
   - Reason: Unused/unfamiliar developer.  
   - Risk: Potential data access (verified no critical permissions).  

### **Impact After Removal**  
- **Performance**: No noticeable change (Brave's native shields cover ad-blocking).  
- **Security**: Reduced attack surface by eliminating unused extensions.
